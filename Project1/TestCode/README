This is just a simple example to create a POSIX message queue and to have to processes 
(a sender and a receiver) use the message queue to exchange data. You can change this example
as you wish (i.e., sending non-printable messages), but do not spend much time here; focus on
the kernel module and proc file portion. 

To compile the code, just do a simple
make

and to run the code, start the receiver first:
./receiver <queue_name> <exp_messages>
as an example:
./receiver /cs3210 50

This will create a message queue named "/cs3210" and the receiver will expect 50 messages. 

after the receiver has started, then run the sender
./sender <queue_name> <num_messages>
as an example:
./sender /cs3210 50

Make sure the queue names and number of messages match.
